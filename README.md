# Snap Style! 

![feature X](images/logo-text.png)

Realtime editing style in a snap!

## Features

Imagine no more file saving or page reloading just to see how single update affects web page, realtime update style in browser immediately, as you type... How many time you can save? how fast we can build our application?

No need to waiting for JS framework build time to see your new style apply. Just type your new style and see the magic happen. 

Base on this idea [Livestyle](http://livestyle.io/). I'm writing an extension for VS code and Chrome that can help Angular developer (or frontend developer) can style faster. It call *Snap Style* that can updates CSS in browser immediately, as you type. No more file saving or page reloading just to see how single update affects web page.
