# SnapCss! 

![feature X](images/logo-text.png)

Realtime editing style in a snap!

Idea behind, there is `_nghost-${COMPONENT_VARIABLE}` in every component in Angular. I Create websocket that listen to the chrome extension, the chrome seek `COMPONENT_VARIABLE` then send it to `vscode`. After that, vscode mix it that component variable with style and send it to chrome extension. then it will update it.

## Requirements
you need install for this plugin to work with:
- Chrome Browser [HERE](https://www.google.com/chrome/) 
- My chrome extension [HERE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/banpiopiepkejkfomncchpdokpnaejnh)

## Install
1. Open Extensions sideBar panel in Visual Studio Code. View â†’ Extensions
2. Search for `SnapCss` then Click Install, Click Reload, if required
3. install chrome extension [HERE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/banpiopiepkejkfomncchpdokpnaejnh) if you not install yet

## Features

Imagine no more file saving or page reloading just to see how single update affects web page, realtime update style in browser immediately, as you type... How many time you can save? how fast we can build our application?

No need to waiting for JS framework build time to see your new style apply. Just type your new style and see the magic happen. 

Base on this idea [Livestyle](http://livestyle.io/). I'm writing an extension for VS code and Chrome that can help Angular developer (or frontend developer) can style faster. It call *SnapCss* that can updates CSS in browser immediately, as you type. No more file saving or page reloading just to see how single update affects web page.

<!-- ## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something -->

## Known Issues

> why my Console in Chrome browser keep yelling Error:
`GET http://localhost:1995/socket.io/?EIO=3&transport=polling&t=MmnbD6d net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` ???

- answer: Because you not open VSCode editor. You just open it and it will shut up or disable SnapCss chrome plugin.
- Still notworking if have @import() or ::ng-deep
